Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Elwoodia, there lived a young and wise young Princess named Isabella. She saw a tiny creature like one of the fairies her mother told her.
One of the fairies flew to her and spoke in a soft voice. The fairy was dressed with colourful flowers and green leaves, with a colourful flower with many petals.
The fairy grabbed some rocks. One was red, crowned with colourful flowers and some green leaves. Many of the fairies were small but quick.
