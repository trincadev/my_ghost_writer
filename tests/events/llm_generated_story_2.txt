Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Elwoodia, there lived a young and wise young Princess named Isabella. She loved nothing more than to explore the world around her and experience new things. One day, she set off on an adventure to find out about the mysterious and enchanting forest beyond the village gate.
As she journeyed through the woods, Isabella stumbled upon a large clearing where she saw a small group of woodland creatures gathered around something. Curious, she went over to take a look. There she noticed a large, red apple lying across the ground. It was so unusual that she had never seen anything like it before; its shape was round but oval, and it was larger than any fruit she'd ever seen.
The creatures surrounding the apple moved aside to let Isabella get a closer look. As she came closer, she saw a tiny fairy perched on top of the apple. The fairy flew to her and spoke in a soft voice.
